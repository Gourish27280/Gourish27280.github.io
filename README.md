# About me:
##  I am a Final year Masters Student in IISER KOLKATA.I am currently working under Professor Kripabandhu Ghosh in the Computational Datascience(CDS) department.My current research interest lies on agentic AI as a part of Masters thesis. I specialized in building custom AI agents and  multiagent frameworks to facilitate complex problem solving and simulating real-world conversational/debate situations.Some of my projects are mentioned below:

# projects
## Simulating US Court room setup using MultiAgent System.
### Created a Multi Agent setup to simulate the conversation taking place in a US Court room using Langgraph.
### Build Custom AI Agents to represent Judges,Plaintiffs,Petitioner. Each agent has its own memory module and is able to generate arguments or respond to them according to the facts of the case.
### Evaluated the responses generated against the Real Court case.
### Improved the conversational abilities of each Agent by performing Fewshot,Guided FewShot and Fine Tuning Methods.

## Data Annotation using MultiAgent Debate system
### Created a MultiAgent Debate Setup using Langgraph.Used this Setup to simulate real world data Annotation scenario.Multiple Agents  annotate a single datapoint.Incase of disagreement the agents debate among themselves to reach a consensus.
### Each Agent is prompted to annotate in a specific kind of Task.They also generate an explanation for their responses.Upon disagreement, They view the reason given by the other Agent and generate argument against it or accept that their initial response was wrong.
### Same setup with slight modification in prompts has been used for Sentiment analysis,Sarcasm detection,Legal annotation.Achieved great improvement in accuracy compared to annotation.
